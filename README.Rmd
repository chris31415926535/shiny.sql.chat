# A simple chat application using R Shiny

This demo shows how to build a basic chat application in R using Shiny and SQLite. It was inspired by [this post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/07/shiny-chat-in-few-lines-of-code-2/), but uses supported R packages and runs locally.

To try it out, clone this repo, load app.R in RStudio, and click "Run App."

The basic logic is:

* Messages are stored in a database. We'll use SQLite, because it's easy, local, and file-based, but in a real project you might use a cloud-based SQL (or noSQL) server.
* When a user sends a message, it's added to the database as a new row.
* Once per second, the app checks the database to see if there are new messages, and if it finds any it downloads them.
* Messages are formatted using CSS based on whether the current username matches the message sender's name.
* A bit of extra JavaScript adds polish by auto-scrolling down when a new message is received.

# Step 1: Set up the database

First, we need to set up the database we'll use to store our chat messages. We'll use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), describe by its authors as "a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine." It also has [first-class support from RStudio](https://solutions.rstudio.com/db/databases/sqlite/) through the [RSQLite package](https://github.com/r-dbi/RSQLite). 

SQLite databases exist as regular files, so we'll name ours `messages.sqlite` and keep it in a folder called `data`. Databases can contain many tables, so we'll store our messages in a table named `messages`.

Then, to initialize our database, we'll create a zero-row tibble to use as a template that we can add rows to later. To keep it simple, we'll store each message's username, date and time, and message, all as characters.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)

# create a zero-row tibble with the correct column names and data types
message_db_schema <- dplyr::tibble(username = character(0),
                                   datetime = character(0),
                                   message = character(0))

# make sure we have a data directory
if (!dir.exists("data")) dir.create("data")

# connect to SQLite database, or create one
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data/messages.sqlite")

# if there is no message table, create one using our schema
if (!"messages" %in% DBI::dbListTables(con)){
  dplyr::copy_to(con, message_db_schema, name = "messages", overwrite = TRUE,  temporary = FALSE )
}
```

Now we have a connection object named `con` that points to our database.

To add a new message, we put our data in a one-row tibble and use `DBI::dbAppendTable()` to add it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
new_message <- dplyr::tibble(
  username = "Chris",
  datetime = Sys.time(),
  message = "Hi everyone!"
)

RSQLite::dbAppendTable(con, "messages", new_message)
```

And to read our message, we use `dplyr::tbl()` to get a connection to the `messages` table, and then call `collect()` to download the results. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
chat_messages <- dplyr::tbl(con, "messages") %>%
  collect()
```

Until we call `collect()`, we're actually operating on data that's *in the database*, not stored in memory. We're not taking advantage of here, but databases give the ability to do a lot of `dplyr`-esque operations *remotely* and then to call `collect()` to download the results once they're processed.

This is really the entirety of the database stuff, and if you had a few friends running R on the same machine you could technically use this to chat with each other.

But, as is so often the case, putting this simple logic into a Shiny app makes it much more impressive!

# Step 2: Make it Shiny

Let's set up the UI for our basic Shiny app. We'll use a `sidebarLayout()` structure with chat controls on the left, and chat messages on the right. We need two inputs: a text field for message text, and a button to send messages. For convenience we'll also add a second button to clear the chat logs. 

I'll present the highlights here, and [you can see the whole thing in the file app-basic.R on GitHub here](https://github.com/chris31415926535/shiny.sql.chat).

Our entire UI code fits into just a few lines:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Define UI for basic chat application
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Application title
  titlePanel("Simple SQL-Powered Chat in R Shiny!"),
  
  # Sidebar with user input and chat controls
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(width = 3,
                 textInput("msg_text", "Message Text:"),
                 actionButton("msg_button", "Send Message"),
                 hr(),
                 actionButton("msg_clearchat", "Clear Chat Log")),
    
    # main chat panel
    mainPanel(tableOutput("messages_basic")))
)
```

Next, we define our server logic. 
To keep it simple we'll assign users random names Ã  la [Firstname Bunchofnumbers](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/firstname-bunchofnumbers)^[`msg_username <- paste0("Chat Enthusiast", round(runif(n=1, min=10^6,max = 10^7)))`], and assume we'll set up a connection `con` to our database as described above.

Then we need:

* A button handler for when people click "Send Message";
* A button handler for when people click "Clear Chat Log";
* A way to regularly check for new messages; and,
* An output that displays new messages as they're received.

To make this all work, we're going to store the current set of messages locally in a `reactiveValues` object. This way our outputs will update automatically if we get new messages. We'll also put the code to read messages into a function since we need to do it in a few different places:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# A separate function in case you want to do any data preparation (e.g. time zone stuff)
read_messages <- function(con){
  dplyr::tbl(con, "messages") %>%
    collect()
}

# read initial set of messages
messages_db <- reactiveValues(messages = read_messages(con))
```

The button handler for sending a message is straightforward but long. *If* there is a valid message to send, then create a one-row tibble with the username/date-time/message, append it to the table `messages` in the database, read the new values from the database, and empty the message-text input area.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Button handler for sending a message
observeEvent(input$msg_button, {
  
  # only do anything if there's a message
  if (!(input$msg_text == "" | is.null(input$msg_text))) {
    
    msg_time <- Sys.time() %>%
      as.character()
    
    new_message <- dplyr::tibble(username = msg_username,
                                 message = input$msg_text,
                                 datetime = msg_time)
    
    RSQLite::dbAppendTable(con, "messages", new_message)
    
    messages_db$messages <- read_messages(con)
    
    # clear the message text
    shiny::updateTextInput(inputId = "msg_text",
                           value = "")
  }
})
```

The button handler for clearing the chat is even simpler: just overwrite the `messages` table in the database with our empty schema:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Button handler for clearing the chat
observeEvent(input$msg_clearchat, {
  dplyr::copy_to(con, message_db_schema, name = "messages", overwrite = TRUE,  temporary = FALSE )
  messages_db <- reactiveValues(messages = read_messages(con))
})
```

The last major piece is to regularly poll the database for new messages. Here we'll use a `reactiveTimer()` that fires once ever 1000 milliseconds and checks the database. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
  # create a reactive timer to check the database regularly
  db_check_timer <- shiny::reactiveTimer(intervalMs = 1000)

  # check the table for updates each second
  observe({
    db_check_timer()
    messages_db$messages <- read_messages(con)
  })
```

And, for completeness, we have a simple `renderTable()` to render our output.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Display our messages using a basic table output
output$messages_basic <- shiny::renderTable(messages_db$messages)
```

If we put this all together, we get a functional chat app!

It may not be pretty, but it *works!* If you run the app and load it in two different browser tabs, you'll see messages from one appear in the other a second later.

# Step 3: Polish it with CSS and Javascript

# Step 4: Next steps?

* We download the *entire* set of messages each time we poll the database. If the chatlogs get big, a better approach might be to only get new messages.
